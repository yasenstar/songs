# HERO

by Mariah Carey

There's a hero

If you look inside your heart

You don't have to be afraid of what you are

There's an answer

If you reach into your soul

and the sorrow that you know will melt away

And then a hero comes along with the strength to carry on

And you cast your fears aside and you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone

Look inside you and be strong

And you'll finally see the truth

That a hero lies in you

It's a long road

When you face the world along

No one reaches out a had for you to hold

You can find love if you search within yourself

And the emptiness you felt will disappear

And then a hero comes along with the strength to carry on

Adn you cast your fears aside and you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone

Look inside you and be strong

And you'll finally see the truth

That a hero lies in you

Load knows

Dreams are hand to follow

But don't let anyone tear them away

Hold on

There will be tomorrow in time you'll find the way

And then a hero comes along witht the strength to carry on

And you case your fears aside and you know you can survive

So when you feel like hope is gone

Look inside you and be strong

And you'll finally see the truth

That a hero lies in you.
